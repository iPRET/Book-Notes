Infinite-set paradoxing has become a morbid infection that is today spreading 
in a way that threatens the very life of probability theory, and it requires 
immediate surgical removal.

...to tell us that a sugar substitute can produce a barely detectable incidence of
cancer in doses 1000 times greater than would ever be encountered in practice, is hardly an
argument against using the substitute... ...A similar overdose of sugar would be far more dangerous,
leading not to barely detectable harmful effects, but to sure, immediate death by diabetic
coma; yet nobody has proposed to ban the use of sugar in food.

When a data set is mutilated (or, to use the common euphemism, 'filtered')...

‘Should one design a bridge using theory involving infinite sets
or the axiom of choice? Might not the bridge collapse?’

This trend is already well under way in several fields, ranging from
econometrics to astronomy to magnetic resonance spectroscopy; but, to make progress in a
new area, it is necessary to develop a healthy disrespect for tradition and authority, which
have retarded progress throughout the 20th century.

In any event, we feel sure that no further clarity would be achieved by taking the first few steps
down that infinite regress that starts with: ‘What do you mean by “exists”?’
